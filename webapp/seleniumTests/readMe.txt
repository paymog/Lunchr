To allow testing these tests without running the application locally you can just set the baseUrl of the seleniumIDE to http://54.200.225.219/

The selenium tests all run but there may be an issue when trying to click the google map markers when there are no restaurants nearby.

MAKE SURE TO CLEAR THE DATABASE EACH TIME YOU RUN THE TESTS with the script in the scripts folder

To run these tests you must open the test suite file with the seleniumIDE in firefox. 
Make sure to have the location sharing always allowed
Make sure to enable popups for the website as well
